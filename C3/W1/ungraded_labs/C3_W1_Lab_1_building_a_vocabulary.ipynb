    "# Ungraded Lab: Building a Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "In most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the initial step in preparing your data is to extract a vocabulary of words from your corpus (i.e. input texts). You will need to define how to represent the texts into numeric features which can be used to train a neural network. Tensorflow and Keras makes it easy to generate these using its APIs. You will see how to do that in the next cells."
